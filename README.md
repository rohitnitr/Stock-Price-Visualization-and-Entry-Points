# Stock Price Analysis and Trading Levels

This code is designed to analyze stock price data and identify support and resistance levels. It also highlights potential entry points for trading based on the identified levels. The code retrieves historical stock price data using the `yfinance` library and plots the data using `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- yfinance
- mplfinance
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:

```
pip install pandas numpy yfinance mplfinance matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Import the required libraries:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance
from mplfinance.original_flavor import candlestick_ohlc
import matplotlib.dates as mpl_dates
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mplcursors
```

2. Set the stock symbol and retrieve the historical data:

```python
name = '^NSEBANK'  # NIFTY BANK index symbol
ticker = yfinance.Ticker(name)
df = ticker.history(interval="1d", start="2023-02-01", end=pd.Timestamp.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d'))
```

3. Prepare the data for plotting:

```python
df['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df.index)
df['Date'] = df['Date'].apply(mpl_dates.date2num)
df = df.loc[:, ['Date', 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Volume']]
```

4. Define functions to identify support and resistance levels:

```python
def isSupport(df, i):
    # Implementation to identify support levels

def isResistance(df, i):
    # Implementation to identify resistance levels
```

5. Identify support and resistance levels and filter out levels that are close to each other:

```python
levels = []
# Implementation to identify support and resistance levels

s = np.mean(df['High'] - df['Low'])

def isFarFromLevel(l):
    # Implementation to filter out levels that are close to each other

levels = []
# Implementation to identify support and resistance levels and filter out levels
```

6. Define a function to find potential entry points for trading:

```python
def find_entry_points():
    # Implementation to find entry points based on support and resistance levels
```

7. Define a function to plot the stock price chart with levels and entry points:

```python
def plot_all():
    # Implementation to plot the candlestick chart with levels and entry points
```

8. Call the `plot_all()` function to generate the plot:

```python
plot_all()
```

## Results

The resulting plot will show the candlestick chart of the stock's price with support and resistance levels indicated by blue lines. Entry points for potential trades are marked with green dots and annotations. The annotations include the price and volume information at each level. Additionally, hovering over the chart will display the price information using the `mplcursors` library.
